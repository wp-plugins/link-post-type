Requires at least: 4.0.0

== Description ==

Allows custom "link" post type which adds a Link URL value custom meta box to the post editor

This allows the posts to be easily redirected to the value of that link. (This will involve a small amount of code in the template used to display posts)

The main idea behind this is that you can easily build up a collection of links which you can tag with various key words.

From this you can quickly set up something in your templates/theme of choice to display related links on your blog posts or other pages along with a thumbnail without the need to type in the same links on all the pages

Note: This plugin does not do the redirect for you, you will have to do that within your chosen template

== Installation ==

Upload the link-post-type folder to the wp-content/plugins directory

Enable "Link Post Type" in the plugins section


== Instructions ==

Click "Links" just below "Posts" in the right hand side admin panel and create a new post, then give it a title, featured image and a link url value.

In your preferred method of displaying a list of links on the site, simply pull in the 3 attributes mentioned above to easily construct a link which you can customise with an image or different title, or change entirely.
